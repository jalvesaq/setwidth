# setwidth
Automatically set the R width option on terminal emulators

This is a copy of `setwidth`, an R package no longer maintained, but still
available at <https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/setwidth/>. The
package was archived on CRAN because R developers implemented an option to
automatically update the `width` when the terminal is resized (look for
`setWidthOnResize` at
<https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/options.html>).
